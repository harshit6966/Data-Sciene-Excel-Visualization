# Data-Sciene-Excel-Visualization
This was a semester project given by my instructor. In this I took a dataset of a Supermarket from Kaggle.com.
And then I analyzed it using different tools and features of Microsoft Excel.
So I analyzed the dataset on the following parameters:
1) Category Wise Quantity Analysis.
2) Region Wise Quantity Analysis.
3) Sales w.r.to timeline from 2011-2014.
4) Shipment Modes and their Cost Analysis.
5) Category Wise Sales.
6) Sales & Profit w.r.to Regions.
7) Sales & Profit w.r.to Order Priority.
8) Sales & Profit w.r.to Timeline.
9) Profits w.r.to Category.
10) Sales w.r.to Sub-Category.
11) Sales & Profit w.r.to Market.

And to analyze it all together in one place I designed an interactive Dashboard.
